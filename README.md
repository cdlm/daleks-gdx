# Daleks in libGDX

This is a minimal game project in Java, using [libGDX][] and built using [Gradle][].
Not intended as a proper game, just a starter project that is easy to load and run
(Hit ESC to quit):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cdlm/daleks-gdx.git
cd daleks-gdx
gradle run
```

To work in an IDE, it should support importing/synchronizing from Gradle.
IntelliJ IDEA CE seems to work fine, Eclipse and Netbeans should too (please tell me if
you try).
